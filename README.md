About this simulator
als : Antenal Lobe Simulator
this simulator is based on github.com/arase/als_v2 
this simulator could run on the cluster
this program simulate  "the response of AL to two alternate general odor stimulation"
the result is saved /result directory

How to use this simulator in cluster
0. load module of mpi (module load torque compiler/gcc-4.8.2 openmpi/1.10.2/gcc-4.8.2.lp)
1. git clone neuron_kplus
2. git clone als_v2_sakai_graduation (this simulator)
3. copy mod files (cp als_v2_sakai_graduation/mod/* to neuron_kplus/mod)
4. compile neuron in the neuron_kplus (refer to the documentation of neuron_kplus)
5. change the path of src1/run.sh
6. change the parameter in src/run.sh 
7. execute the program (sh run.sh)
run.sh : simulate Antennal Lobe neuron and its synaptic changes against to continuous two different odor stimulation
for more information please reference my graduate thesis
